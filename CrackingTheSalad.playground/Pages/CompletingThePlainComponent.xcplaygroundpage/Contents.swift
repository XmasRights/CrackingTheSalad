# Completing The Plain Component

One of the easiest methods to crack the code is to check all 26 possibilities (for English) and use a human to pick the answer ðŸ¤–
 
For that we will need a Caesar cipher implementation!
 
- Note:
 You can implement it below and when tests are passing move it to `Sources/CaesarCipher.swift` so you can access it in the next tasks.

import UIKit
import XCTest


// Tests
let testSubject = "SWIFT"

print(cipher(testSubject, offset: 70))

// Cipher and decipher ðŸ‘‰ should be the same as at the beginning
XCTAssertEqual(cipher(testSubject, offset: 4), "WAMJX")
XCTAssertEqual(cipher(cipher(testSubject, offset: -4), offset: 4), testSubject)
XCTAssertEqual(cipher(cipher(testSubject, offset: 70), offset: -70), testSubject)

/*:
 
 ## Bruteforce it ðŸ’£
 
*/
let superSecretText = "FAUW QGM ZSNW VGFW AL"

// Check all possibilities and show which offset is the answer

//(1...25).forEach { print("\($0): \(cipher(superSecretText, offset: $0))") }

// The answer is: 8
